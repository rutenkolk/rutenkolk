- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kristin Rutenkolk (sometimes wiredaemon on the internet)
  
  I'm currently a CS phd student a the Heinrich Heine University of DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany working at the [chair of Software Engineering and Programming Languages](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/software-engineering-and-programming-languages) .

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in way to many things: 
  - formal methods
  - programming languages
  - functional programming
  - logic programming
  - gpu programming (Cuda, halide, OpenGL, Vulkan(not if I can choose))
  - current programming languages of choice (roughly in order): 
    - f#
    - c++
    - clojure (f# took the functional spotlight for me recently)
    - java
    - prolog
    - zig
    - rust
  - exact real arithmetic
  - self-validating numerical methods such as:
    - Interval arithmetic
    - ball arithmetic
    - affine arithmetic
    - others
  - real constraint solving (such as ibex-lib) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
  - f# 
  - my way around the dotnet ecosystem
  - rust

I will probably expand on this site in the future.
