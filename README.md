- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kristin Rutenkolk (sometimes wiredaemon on the internet)
  
  I'm currently a CS phd student a the Heinrich Heine University of DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany working at the [chair of Software Engineering and Programming Languages](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/software-engineering-and-programming-languages) .

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested among other things in: 
  - formal methods
  - programming languages
  - functional programming
  - logic programming
  - gpu programming (Cuda, halide, OpenGL, Vulkan(not if I can choose))
  - exact real arithmetic
  - self-validating numerical methods such as:
    - Interval arithmetic
    - ball arithmetic
    - affine arithmetic
    - others
  - real constraint solving (such as ibex-lib) 


  - current programming languages of choice (roughly in order): 
    - f#
    - clojure
    - java
    - prolog
    - zig
    - c++

I have [a twitter](https://twitter.com/Wire_Daemon) but I'm no longer very active there.
I mostly post stuff about what I work on and other related things on [my cohost](https://cohost.org/wiredaemon).
